/*The exercise is the following:

We are going to do a game, we have three classes : wizard, soldier and thief.

Wizard uses mp (magic points) to do damage and has Low health. 

    -health: 200
    -damage: 1000
    -mp: 300

Soldier has a lot of health, low damage and uses stamina to attack.

    -health: 1000
    -damage: 500
    -stamina: 500

Thief has Low health, crazy damage and uses stamina to attack.

    -health: 300
    -damage: 2000
    -stamina: 1000


The idea is that the user can choose 2 characters from the three classes and make them fight each other, 
you can use 5 hp (health potions) and 5 stamina or mp (magic points) potions depending of the character.
